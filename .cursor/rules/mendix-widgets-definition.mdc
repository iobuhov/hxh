This is a Widget Definition XML file. It determines what props are given to the widget and how the Mendix Developer
configures the widget.

Group properties in property groups, so that Mendix Developers have an easier time finding a particular property in the
configuration panel. You can nest properties in at most two levels of groups. The first level is shown as a tab, the
second as a fieldset.

When making changes refer to the file's schema. It is located in `node_modules/mendix/custom_widget.xsd`. It will inform
you what combinations of elements and attributes are allowed.

Be aware that certain property types can be linked to datasources using a `dataSource` attribute. This will explicitly
link the property to the datasource, giving it access to attributes and associations which are reachable from the
datasource in question. This is your main mechanism for specifying constraints on your data. Note that datasources must
have the `isList="true"` attribute.

Actions allow you to trigger other behaviors in the Mendix App. Common usecases are the opening of another page, or the
triggering of a Microflow -- A Mendix concept which encapsulates business logic for an app. Using Action Variables you
can provide primitive arguments. To provide entities as arguments you can link the action to a datasource.

When writing prop captions, use sentence case.
